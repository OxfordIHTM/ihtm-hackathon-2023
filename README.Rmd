This repository contains instructions, data and code for the [University
of Oxford MSc in International Health and Tropical
Medicine](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-international-health-and-tropical-medicine)
inaugural **Hackathon 2023**. The **Hackathon 2023** event is part of
the [MSc course](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-international-health-and-tropical-medicine)’s
[lecture series on Open Science and Reproducible Research in
R](https://oxford-ihtm.io/open-reproducible-science).

## Motivation

**Hackathon 2023** caps the students’ introduction to [Open Science and
Reproducible Research in
R](https://oxford-ihtm.io/open-reproducible-science) through an actual
global health project within which they are to serve as researchers/data
scientists. This exercise aims to provide the students a platform from
which to apply skills in working with data using R that they have been
learning and practicing for about the past 6 weeks while at the same
time exposing them to a collaborative team environment

## Format

**Hackathon 2023** is structured as a **problem-based learning**
exercise, a format that the course students are already familiar with
given similar approaches done for other lectures. Briefly, this PBL
exercise presents the problem first rather than teaching relevant
material and subsequently having students apply the knowledge to solve
the problem. Whilst the previous lectures in the [Open Science and
Reproducible Research in
R](https://oxford-ihtm.io/open-reproducible-science) series have
provided foundational skills in R, the PBL approach for this hackathon
will challenge the students to further explore and learn the extensive
functionalities R has to offer in order to appropriately solve the
problem/s they have been given to solve. This PBL is group-orientated
and simulates a collaborative research/data science working environment
facilitated through the use of [git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[GitHub](https://github.com).

Through this approach, the students are expected to:

1.  Examine and define the problem.

2.  Explore what they already know about underlying issues related to
    it.

3.  Determine what they need to learn and where they can acquire the
    information and tools necessary to solve the problem.

4.  Evaluate possible ways to solve the problem.

5.  Solve the problem.

6.  Report on their findings.

## The case

The case study along with the hackathon rules are presented here -
<https://oxford-ihtm.io/ihtm-hackathon-2023/case_study.html>.

## Repository/project structure

- `renv/` contains the project-specific R package library created by the
  `{renv}` package (see section below on **Reproducibility** for details)
  
- `renv.lock` is the file created by the `{renv}` package that lists out
  the various packages used in this project 
  (see section below on **Reproducibility** for details)

- `data/` contains the coverage assessment dataset called
  `nutrition_survey_dataset.csv`

- `R/` contains functions created or that will be created for use in
  this project

Currently, this folder contains an R file called `get_data.R`. This
file specifies a function called `get_data()` which retrieves and
processes the data for this hackathon. It also saves this dataset as a
CSV file called `nutrition_survey_dataset.csv` in the `data` folder.

- `outputs/` contains figures, intermediate or final results tables, 
  and other outputs

- `docs/` contains compiled reports produced from R Markdown documents

Currently, this folder contains the file `case_study.html` which is the
HTML output of `case_study.Rmd` (see below) which details the case study and 
the rules for this hackathon

- `case_study.Rmd` is the R Markdown file that produces the `case_study.html`
  file found in the `outputs` folder

- `coverage_assessment.R` is the R workflow script for the coverage assessment
  analysis
  
- `coverage_assessment_report.Rmd` is the R Markdown for the coverage
  assessment report
  
## Reproducibility

This project requires R version 4.2.2. This project uses the `{renv}` 
framework to record R package dependencies and versions. Packages and 
versions used are recorded in `renv.lock` and code used to manage 
dependencies is in the `renv/` directory. 

To work on this project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this project onto your local machine. Instructions on how this is 
   done can be found 
   [here](https://oxford-ihtm.io/ihtm-handbook/clone-repository.html).

2. Run `renv::restore()` to install R package dependencies.


Once all R package dependencies have been installed, you should be able
to work on this hackathon project. Please ensure that before making any
changes and contributions, create a new local branch from main
(see [here](https://oxford-ihtm.io/ihtm-handbook/participate-projects.html#create-a-new-branch-from-the-main-branch)
for instructions on how to create a new branch)
